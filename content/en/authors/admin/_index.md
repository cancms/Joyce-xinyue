## About  me

Hi! I am a second-year master student in the Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley under the mentorship of [Prof. Baoxia Mi](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/mi) and Dr. Wenli Jiang.

My research experience covers water treatment, decarbonization and environmental economics. And My research interest lies in studying physicochemical and biological process such as electrochemical and photocatalytic process, solar evaporation, membrane separation, nanocatalysis, biotransformation and biodegradation to enable desalination, water reuse, nutrient/ energy recovery and public health protection. I'm also interested in transport and interfacial phenomena, non-target screening for the occurrence and fate of emerging contaminants, like PFAS, and exploring my possibility in decarbonization, AI, and digital twins. 

I am currently involved in two projects. One project focuses on developing 3D interfacial solar evaporator for mineral recovery. Another project explores an electrified porous filter integrated system for Cr (VI) reduction. While gaining hand-on experience in lab, I am also strengthening my theoretical foundation by taking electronic materials characterization and auditing electrochemistry. At a broader level, I have studied UNEP report, EPA strategic plan, NAWI roadmap and figured out the underlying priorities guiding environmental research. In addition, I enjoy reading a broad range of papers, which helps me identify limitations of current science and technologies, and envision future research direction.

Besides, I am also open to industry. Growing up near Shennongjia National Park and the Yangtze River in China, I am passionate about advancing sustainable environmental solutions across water, energy, and resource systems. Therefore, I am seeking roles as a process engineer or environmental consultant/ scientist. With skills in project management, data analysis, and technical communication, I aim to bridge science and engineering to create efficient real-world impacts.

In my free time, I enjoy yoga and dancing. I am also an academic live streamer on Chinese social media “BiliBili” (check [here](https://space.bilibili.com/359483232)). Talented scholars from all over the world gather here, discussing about novel theories and advanced technologies in English. I’d like to connect and exchange ideas. Let’s make a change together!
